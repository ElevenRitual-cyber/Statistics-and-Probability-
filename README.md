# Statistics and Probability Repository

Welcome to the **Statistics and Probability** repository! This repository serves as a collection of concepts, formulas, and implementations related to statistics and probability, making it a valuable resource for students, data scientists, and anyone interested in understanding these topics.

## 📌 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ **Introduction to Statistics**
- Role of statistics in scientific methods
- Current applications of statistics
- Scientific data gathering:
  - Sampling techniques
  - Scientific studies
  - Observational studies
  - Data management
- Data description:
  - Displaying data on a single variable (graphical methods, measure of central tendency, measure of spread)
  - Displaying relationships between two or more variables
  - Measure of association between two or more variables

### 2️⃣ **Probability Theory**
- Sample space and events
- Probability and axioms of probability
- Independent events
- Conditional probability
- Bayes’ theorem
- Random Variables:
  - Discrete and continuous random variables
  - Probability distribution of discrete random variables (Binomial, Poisson)
  - Probability distribution of continuous random variables (Uniform, Normal (Gaussian), Exponential, Gamma, Beta, t-distribution)
- Expectations, variance, and covariance
- Probability Inequalities
- Bivariate distributions

### 3️⃣ **Point and Interval Estimations**
- Methods of finding estimators:
  - Method of moments
  - Maximum likelihood estimators
  - Bayes estimators
- Methods of evaluating estimators:
  - Mean squared error
  - Best unbiased estimator
  - Sufficiency and unbiasedness
- Interval Estimations:
  - Confidence interval of means and proportions
  - Distribution-free confidence interval of percentiles

### 4️⃣ **Statistical Hypothesis Testing and Bayesian Statistics**
- Tests of statistical hypothesis and p-values:
  - Tests about one mean
  - Tests of equality of two means
  - Test about proportions
  - p-values
  - Likelihood ratio test
  - Bayesian tests
- Bayesian Statistics:
  - Bayesian inference of discrete random variables
  - Bayesian inference of binomial proportion
  - Comparing Bayesian and frequentist inferences of proportion
  - Comparing Bayesian and frequentist inferences of mean
- Univariate Statistics using Python:
  - Mean, Mode, Median, Variance, Standard Deviation
  - Normal Distribution, t-distribution
  - Interval estimation
  - Hypothesis Testing
  - Pearson correlation test
  - ANOVA
